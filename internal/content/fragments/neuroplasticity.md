These are my personal notes and reflections on, [Neuroplasticity: Rewiring Your Brain To Do Hard Things](https://ixcarus.substack.com/p/neuroplasticity-rewiring-your-brain)

We think **change** is about motivation or about willpower.
We think just "wanting it bad enough" will work.

It's not. It never will.

Change is about **neuroplasticity**. It's about literally rewiring the physical structure of our brain 
so that the new behaviour becomes as automatic as the old one.

### What Neuroplasticity Actually is?
Our brain is not fixed.

Our brain is constantly rewiring itself based on what you do, what you think, and what you pay attention to.
Every single experience you have, every thought you think, every action you take is literally reshaping the physical structure of our brain.

This is Neuroplasticity — *“The brain's ability to form new neural connections and reorganise existing ones.”*

Neuroplasticity is **value-neutral**. 

It doesn't care if we're building good habits or bad ones. 
It doesn't distinguish between productive patterns and destructive ones.
Our brain just reinforces whatever we do repeatedly.

If we scroll tiktok for three hours every night, our brain optimises for that. It builds stronger pathways for distraction and dopamine-seeking.
If we read for three hours every night, our brain optimises for that. It builds stronger pathways for focus and information processing.

The mechanism is the same. **The brain doesn't judge. It just adapts**.

### The Neuroscience of Why Change is Hard?
Our current habits, behaviours, and patterns exist because they're neurologically efficient. 
Our brain has spent years, maybe decades, myelinating those neural pathways. 

**Myelin** is this fatty substance that wraps around neural connections and makes signals travel faster. 
The more we use that pathway, the more myelinated it becomes, the more automatic the behavior.

This is why our bad habits feel effortless. They're running on superhighways of myelin.

When we try to build a new habit, we're creating a brand new neural pathway from scratch. No Myelin, slow signal transmission, requires conscious effort every single time.
And our brain fucking hates this.

Our brain is an **efficiency machine**. It's constantly trying to automate as much as possible to save energy. 
**Conscious effort** requires a ton of glucose and oxygen. It's **metabolically expensive**.

So our brain is literally fighting everytime when we try to do something new because from its perspective, 
we're wasting precious resources on an unproven pathway when there's a perfectly good myelinated highway right there.

This is the internal resistance we feel when we try to change.
It's not weakness or lack of discipline. 
It's simply our brain **doing exactly what it evolved to do and trying to conserve energy by defaulting to established patterns**.

Also, brain also **predicts the future based on the past**.

There's thing called **predictive processing** where our brain is constantly generating predictions about what's going to happen next based on what usually happens.

If we usually eat like shit, our brain predicts that we're going to eat like shit today, and then it generates the cravings and impulses to make that prediction come true.
If we usually procrastinate, our brain predicts that we're going procrastinate today, and then it makes us feel resistant to starting work.

Our brain is essentially running a self-fulfilling prophecy loop based on our past behaviour.

### Identity is Neurological
Our brain doesn't believe statements. It believes evidence.
If I tell myself, "I'm a disciplined person" while my behaviour shows zero discipline, my brain dismisses the statement as noise.

It **trusts behaviour over belief**.

So the only way to change identity is through behavioral evidence that accumulates over time until our brain updates its model.<br>
We need to prove the new identity to ourselves through repeated actions until the new neural pattern is stronger than the old one.

### The Role of Stress and Discomfort
When we're doing something difficult, something that requires real effort, our brain releases neuromodulators like **norepinephrine** and **acetylcholine**.<br>
These chemicals create a state of heightened alertness and focused attention. They mark whatever happening right now as “important, pay attention, encode this”.

This is the neurochemical signal that triggers plasticity.

Without it, we're not actually creating lasting change. We're just going through the motions.<br>
This is why people always say to step out of our comfort zone. <br>
Our comfort zone is neurologically stagnant.

When we're comfortable, our brain isn't releasing the chemicals needed for plasticity. We're not encoding anything new.
We're just reinforcing existing patterns.

Growth requires putting ourselves in situations where we're legitimately challenged. <br>
If we feel discomfort, it's not a sign that we're doing something wrong. It's simply the signal that **neuroplasticity** is happening.

This is why the most effective way to change is through repeated exposure to challenging situations.<br>
Not traumatically challenging, not overwhelming, but challenging enough that our brain has to work.

### The Timing Paradox
Here's something weird about neuroplasticity.

It's easy to think it happens at the moment we're performing the behaviour.<br>
In reality, it happens during rest. Specifically during sleep.

When we're learning something new or practising a new behaviour, we're creating temporary changes in neural activity. <br>
But those **changes don't become permanent until our brain consolidates them during sleep**.

This is why sleep is so fucking critical for any kind of change.
