[The Alchemist](https://www.amazon.in/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/8172234988) is one of those books I kept hearing about long before I ever became a reader — back in the phase when books felt distant or irrelevant to me. <br>
But once I finally read it, I understood why people spoke about it so often.

One idea that has stayed with me ever since is this:
**there are always signs, hints, and subtle nudges around us when we’re making decisions — we just need to notice them.** <br>
Strangely, this was something I already believed in even before reading it. That instinct, that pull toward certain choices or paths, had always been part of me.

**_“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.”_**

### Highlights that Stayed
- We often forget that **love is meant to be an impulse forward**, not something that holds us back. Those who truly care for us want our happiness and are willing to walk beside us.
- Those who fight for their dreams suffer more when things don’t work out, because **warriors of light must learn patience** and trust that the universe is working in their favor, even when they can’t see how.

- People become angry when someone isn’t what they want them to be.
    > “Everyone seems to know how others should live, but few know how to live their own lives.”

- When young, everyone knows their destiny. <br>
  At that age, everything seems possible, and we aren’t afraid to dream. <br>
  But as time passes, a mysterious force convinces us that fulfilling our destiny is impossible.

- There is one great truth:
  > “When you truly want something, that desire comes from the Soul of the Universe — it’s your mission on Earth.”

- The Soul of the World is nourished by both happiness and sorrow. <br>
  Realizing one’s destiny is a person’s greatest obligation. Everything is connected.

- If you start by promising what you don’t have, you lose the motivation to work for it.

### The Principle of Favorability (Beginner’s Luck)
- When you do something for the first time, you’re almost sure to win. <br>
  > “Because a force wants you to pursue your destiny — it gives you an early taste of success.”

### The Secret of Happiness
- **See the marvels of the world, but never forget the drops of oil on the spoon.** <br>
  A shepherd may love to travel, but he must not forget his sheep.

- Good things, when they come unexpectedly, bring joy. <br>
  But if you know bad things ahead of time, you suffer long before they happen.

- **People fear pursuing their biggest dreams because they believe they don’t deserve** them or won’t achieve them. <br>
  Their hearts fear loss, regret, and missed opportunities — so they choose safety over possibility.

- **Does a man’s heart always help him?** <br>
  Mostly, it helps those who try to fulfill their destinies — and it also helps children, drunkards, and the elderly. <br>
  The heart does what it can.

- Everyone has a treasure waiting for them. <br>
  But people stop listening to their hearts, so those treasures go unspoken and unexplored. <br>
  Very few follow the path to their destiny — and to happiness.
  > “The darkest hour of the night comes just before dawn.”

- **Every person plays a central role in the history of the world, even if they don’t realize it.**
