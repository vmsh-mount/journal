## Highlights that stayed with me

One of the book’s simplest but most unsettling ideas is this asymmetry in how we think about time. 
When we imagine traveling to the past, we’re warned not to touch anything—a crushed insect could erase our existence. 
Yet in the present, we behave as if tiny actions don’t matter. Miss a bus, send a careless message, take a different route home—surely none of that changes the future in a meaningful way. 
But that belief collapses under its own logic. If every microscopic detail of the past created our present, then every microscopic detail of the present is actively creating the future.

There is concept in philosophy known as **_amor fati_**, or love of one's fate.
We are not just shaped by our parents, but by an unbroken chain of survivals, coincidences, and near-misses stretching back thousands of generations. 
You are the precise outcome of ancestors meeting at exactly the right moments. Shift the timing by seconds, and someone else exists instead. 
As Dawkins put it, we are surrounded by “**unborn ghosts**”: infinite possible people who never came to be. Our existence rests on shockingly fragile foundations.

Klaas pushes this idea beyond poetry and into science. 
**Chaos theory** shows that even deterministic systems—systems governed by fixed laws—can be wildly unpredictable. 
**Edward Lorenz** demonstrated that altering a weather model by a trillionth of a unit could produce hurricanes instead of sunshine weeks later. 
The **butterfly effect** wasn’t a metaphor; it was a mathematical reality. Small causes don’t reliably produce small effects. Sometimes they change everything.

_Consider our eyes instead. We've evolved extraordinarily complex, specialized rod and cone cells in our retinas that allow us to sense light, which our brains can process and translate into vivid images of the world. 
Those abilities are crucial to our survival. But for most of Earth's history, animals didn't have eyes. 
That was, until a random mutation accidentally created a clump of light-sensitive cells. 
Those fortunate creatures could tell when they were in brighter or darker spaces, which helped them survive. 
Over time, this survival advantage was reinforced through evolution by natural selection. 
Eventually, we ended up with sophisticated eyes, derived from a mutation to a snippet of DNA called the PAX6 gene. 
At first glance, that random PAX6 mutation seems like another contingent event: our distant ancestors got lucky. 
Millions of years later, we can watch Netflix._

Book draws a crucial distinction between **convergence** and **contingency**. 
Convergence says outcomes are inevitable: if one path didn’t happen, another would have led to the same result. 
Contingency says history hinges on accidents. 
Klaas argues that we cling to convergence because it’s comforting. 
If outcomes are inevitable, then mistakes don’t matter much. 
But the evidence—from evolution to human history—suggests the opposite. 
Single mutations, freak accidents, and one-off events repeatedly open paths that never existed before, while closing others forever.

> **Convergence is the "everything happens for a reason" school of evolutionary biology. Contingency is the "stuff happens" theory.**

The world, then, isn’t neatly separable into signal and noise. There is no noise. 
One person’s randomness is another person’s defining cause. 
We live in an intertwined system where distant decisions—by strangers, by the dead, by microbes inside our own bodies—shape outcomes we experience as personal. 
Even the concept of the “individual” breaks down under scrutiny. Biologically, we are **holobionts**: human cells entangled with bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that influence mood, behavior, and health. 
We have never been singular.

_The toxoplasma parasite, for example, affects the behavior of infected animals so much that wolves who have the parasite become bolder and end up being more likely to become the leader of the wolf pack. 
The same parasite is often found in cats, meaning that humans who own cats are more likely to be infected, with some studies suggesting that it alters human behavior significantly. 
Roughly one in four humans is currently infected with toxoplasma._

_Until about 2 billion years ago, all living things on Earth were uncomplicated, tiny prokaryotes, single cells without a nucleus, such as bacteria and their cousins, archaea. 
Then, for reasons unknown, a single bacterium bumped into a prokaryotic cell and ended up inside it. 
That bacterium eventually evolved into a mitochondrion, the powerhouse of our cells. 
In that instant, everything changed. Every future species of complex life-from trees to grass and snails to humans-owes its existence to this unexpected microbial merger. 
It's unsettling that the entirety of the human saga can be traced back to a microscopic accident, It happened just once, 2 billion years ago—and never again since. 
It is, perhaps, the greatest fluke of all time._

This interconnectedness is uncomfortable because it undermines control. 
Humans prefer clean stories: X caused Y. 
Big events should have big causes. 
That bias explains **superstition**, **conspiracy theories**, and our addiction to narrative. 
Randomness feels intolerable, so we invent reasons—even false ones—rather than admit uncertainty. 
We are, as psychologists describe, **storytelling animals**. We remember plots, not lists of facts.

_E. M. Forster once wrote ""The king died and then the queen died is a story. 
"The king died and then the queen died of grief" is a plot." 
The detective novelist P. D. James agreed, but suggested that the plot might be improved with the addendum "Everyone thought that the queen had died of grief until they discovered the puncture mark in her throat." 
The three sentences proceed in order from least to most memorable._

_The first has no causation and is therefore just a list of unrelated facts, he sort of information we find most difficult to retain. 
The second invoke, causation, but provides the reason for the queen's demise immediately dampening our interest. 
The third, however, makes us wonder who the puncture mark in the queen's throat, and that causal cliff-hangers easily remembered. 
It's why mystery writers produce bestsellers and why true crime dominates podcast and documentary charts. 
We war to know who, but above all, we must know why._

_Conspiracy theories thrive on such cognitive biases, including magnitude bias. Following the simplistic linear worldview, big events must have big causes, not small, accidental, or random ones. 
Christopher French, who led the anomalistic psychology unit at Goldsmith, University of London, told me that Princess Diana's death spurred so many conspiracy theories precisely because many people wouldn't tolerate the notion that such an important event could have been caused by mere human error and the mundane deadliness of a car traveling too fast. 
Something else had to be going on, the conspiracists figure, a secret pattern waiting to be detected. 
They're even willing to accept mutually contradictory explanations rather than rule out a larger, hidden explanation. 
Some conspiracists believe Diana is still alive and that she was killed by British security services. 
The logical impossibility of both being true is less of a problem to the conspiracists than the unsatisfying explanation that it was an accident._

Klaas makes a sharp point here: usefulness beats truth. 
Evolution didn’t shape our minds to perceive reality accurately; it shaped them to survive. 
**We are shortcut creatures, not truth creatures**. 
We filter, simplify, label, and misread constantly—and often that’s adaptive. 
But it also means our mental models of society, history, and causality are deeply flawed.

This becomes especially clear in complex systems. A Swiss watch is complicated but predictable. 
Society is complex: adaptive, nonlinear, path-dependent. 
Small changes can trigger cascades, tipping points, and irreversible shifts. 
Patterns from the past don’t reliably guide the future once the system itself changes. 
This is why probabilistic forecasts often fail—not because math is useless, but because uncertainty is sometimes irreducible. 
In those cases, “I don’t know” is more honest than a fake precision.

_Complex systems, such as locust swarms or modern human society, involve diverse, interacting, and interconnected parts (or individuals) that adapt to one another.
The system, like our world, is in constant flux. If you change one aspect of the system, other parts spontaneously adjust, creating something altogether new. 
If one person pumps the brakes while driving, or if a person in a crowd stops to chat to someone else, people don't just carry on, following a fixed trajectory. 
They adapt and adjust. The entire flow of people or cars in the system can be drastically affected by a single small change._

_As a result, complex adaptive systems are path dependent, a bit like the **Garden of Forking Paths**. 
If you take one path, it will affect which future paths are available to you, just as the arbitrary layout of the QWERTY keyboard long ago now means that we still type with that system. 
Even if a better keyboard layout is developed, it's too late—we've already made out choice. 
As a result, to understand a complex adaptive system, you must also understand its history._

_Because complex systems are nonlinear, which means that scale of change is not proportionate to the magnitude of the effect, small changes do sometimes produce a major, unpredictable event- the **Black Swans** that Taleb warned about. 
They are often the result in cascades, which are consequential but difficult to anticipate. 
And when the cascades happen, we often can't understand them-even with the benefit of hindsight._

_We hear probabilistic statements constantly. But what does it actually mean to say that there's an 80 percent chance of rain today? 
The answer seems obvious until you try to explain it to someone else. 
Does it mean that, given the exact same initial physical conditions in the atmosphere, rain will occur 80 percent of the time (as though weather patterns are like rolling dice with static odds)?
Does it mean that out of one hundred possible imagined worlds with similar conditions to today, rain should be expected to happen in eighty of them, but not twenty others? 
Does it forecasters want you to know that they have an 80 percent confidence mean that the evidence is uncertain in the weather model, but that the level in the prediction that it will rain?_

_Imagine it's 1995 and you've been asked to predict how many hours per day the average British person will spend using his or her telephone by the year 2020. 
You could study past patterns until the cows come home and use whatever forms of Bayesian logic you wanted, but it wouldn't likely have helped. 
In 1995, 1 out of every 130 people used the internet. The iPhone wouldn't be invented for another twelve years. 
It wouldn't matter whether you used a supercomputer with the most sophisticated formulas known to humanity, and it wouldn't matter whether your statistical models generated a probability using frequency-based or belief-based logic. 
Any probabilistic forecast in 1995 about phone usage in 2020 would have been wildly off. Why? Because the relationship between humans and phones fundamentally changed Plus, a once-in-a-century pandemic kept people at home and bored. 
The world became different. A few prescient futurists in 1995 might have anticipated the rise of smartphones, but their insights would have come from understanding emerging technology, not from probabilistic reasoning based on patterns from history. 
When the world changes, the past can't always guide us. We get lost when we use probabilities in the Land of Heraclitean Uncertainty_

_Astonishingly, recent research on the fossilized remains of hominins living in the Rift Valley shows that periods of abrupt climate changes overlap with the expansions of brain size observed in the fossil record. 
Studies also suggest that humans invented more advanced kinds of tools during three different periods of extreme climate volatility. 
These correlations have led some scientists to conclude that our intelligence evolved to cope with these sudden, sharp environmental shifts, as intelligence and the social cooperation it made possible were useful for survival. 
A chaotic climate in a geological hot spot may be the reason why we're smart._

_Nonetheless, our environment is a key factor that partially determines human history, even though past thinkers have perverted geographical explanations as a stalking horse for racism. 
There's a crucial difference between theories that claim that the physical environment makes certain people inferior (which is racist and absurd), and those that demonstrate that environmental factors constrain choices and create historical paths that societies in certain geographies are more likely to follow. 
The intersection of human action with environmental factors often produces unexpected results. 
Britain could build ships because it had wood, and it wanted to build ships because it was an island. 
Had modern humans emerged at a different time in geological history, Britain might have been a landlocked wasteland. 
There would be no Royal Navy, and, likely, no British Empire. Geographic factors alter the choices that people make. That changes history._

The world plainly varies wildly in geographic features that directly affect human prosperity. 
Fresh water is required not just for survival, but for irrigation. Some places have it, others don't. 
The growing season is affected by latitude, soil type, minerals, rainfall patterns, the climate, even the angle of the sunlight. 
Some regions are blessed with fertility, others cursed with barrenness. 
Some regions face voracious predators and crippling diseases, others are free from both.
The earth produces a geographic lottery. Some societies won, others lost.

So, are we just along for the ride, or does each of us determine the destination? 
In late 2015, the New York Times Magazine polled its readers with a hypothetical question: **If you could travel back in time and kill Hitler when he was still a baby, would you do it?** 
If you shove aside all the glaring problems with the logic of time travel and accept the premise of the question, it seems at first glance to be a straightforward moral dilemma. 
For a utilitarian, it should be an easy calculation: yes, you should kill one baby to save the lives of millions of innocent future victims. 
Others who take a more puritan, Kantian approach to morality see it differently. 
Baby Hitler may grow up to be adult Hitler, but one may never justify killing an innocent infant. 
Forty-two percent of readers said they'd kill baby Hitler, 30 percent said they wouldn't, and 28 percent said they weren't sure.

But the baby Hitler question is more profound than a thorny moral dilemma. The right answer pivots on our view of how history works and why change happens. 
Chaos theory proves that small changes can produce enormous impacts, so any manipulation of the past would risk drastic change, making the thought experiment even more uncertain.

Implicit in the baby Hitler thought experiment is the idea that without Hitler the Nazis wouldn't rise to power in Germany, World Wat II wouldn't happen, and the Holocaust would be avoided.
It therefore assumes that Hitler was the sole, or at least the crucial, cause of those events. 
Many historians would take issue with that viewpoint, arguing that those cataclysms were all but inevitable. 
Hitler might have affected some outcomes, they'd say, but not the overall trajectory of events. 
The Nazis, the war, and the genocide were due to larger factors than just one man.

Even if you're willing to accept that killing Hitler would reshape history, the baby Hitler hypothetical also (understandably) assumes that a world without Hitler would turn out much better. 
While it's hard to imagine, some have suggested that a world without Hitler could have been even worse. 
The British writer and actor Stephen Fry wrote a novel in which a graduate student travels back in time and makes Hitler's father infertile. 
Nazism still emerges, but the leader who rises to power is more rational and less impulsive than Hitler was, which leads to Germany acquiring nuclear weapons, winning the war, and killing millions more Jews. Would that have happened? 
It's impossible to say. But what's certain is that changing a complex past would create unpredictable futures. 
In that way, the baby Hitler question hinges not just on morality, but on views about historical causality-and whether and how deleting one individual from the past would change the story of our species. We can never know.

That's a curious view for a historian to take because even if the past can't be changed, considering alternative path ways is a useful tool in trying to understand why any given event took place. 
Speculating on what might have been can reveal insights about what really was. 
This is important to get right because, as we've already seen, the narratives we believe shape our behavior-and history is all about narratives. 
> "History is not what happened, but it is what we agree happened"

One of the first questions most people ask a first encounter with someone new is **"What do you do?"** 
The answer instantly rejiggers our interpretation of the person. 
This produces bias The right information with the wrong signal gets ignored, producing yen another challenge to the structured, systematic view of change.

Neuroscience and psychology research repeatedly finds that these mental labels provide the filters through which we process fresh revelations about the world, and about the people we meet within it.

_We're again trapped by the contingencies of language, as you're likely to radically change your assessment of someone you meet if the person is introduced as an "entrepreneur as opposed to an "influencer." 
even if it's the same individual. Yet, those meanings-and the credibility we attach to them-change over time. 
What would someone in the 199os make of a person called an "influencer"? Who knows? But it would certainly be different from the connotations glued to that word today. 
Our mental maps and schemas are not fixed, but constantly shifting. That means that the very words we use to describe people, or to categorize them in our minds, can affect whether the information we receive from them is trusted or discarded, which produces more unpredictable outcomes._

_Our brains are therefore designed to allow us to quickly categorize people and assess, even subconsciously, whether we should listen to them. 
We often get it wrong. Plenty of serious-seeming people in slick suits with eminent degrees and an abundance of charming confidence have repeatedly crashed the economy, dragged us into wars, and inflicted tremendous global suffering. 
So, it's not just who says something, but how we perceive the person saying it._

**Perhaps the genius matters less than the idea that forms a stroke of genius**. 
Maybe our world wouldn't be that different if Einstein had been ignored, his ideas dismissed as the fantasies of a delusional patent clerk. 
Somebody else would have made his discoveries and it would've been a wash because it's the equations that matter, not who writes them. 
But is that true? This is an important question because if even scientific ideas are at least partly contingent on which individual comes up with them, then it's hard to dispute that just about everything is contingent and prone to flukes created by individuals.

_I'm certainly not the first to raise the notion that individuals can radically alter the history of science. But the standard rebuttal to this argument almost always points to the same man: Charles Darwin. 
Does it matter that it was Charles Darwin, specifically, who proposed evolutionary theory? Wouldn't someone else have come up with the same theory if he hadn't, the same way that Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented calculus around the same time as Isaac Newton?_

_The objection is apt because someone else did propose a theory of evolution at roughly the same time as Charles Darwin, an English naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace.
The tale of these two men is frequently used to support an anti-Kuhnian, dispassionate, convergent view of science. Great discoveries are "in the air" when they're made, part of a scientific trend. 
It wouldn't particularly affect the trajectory of progress whether it was Darwin or Wallace who pioneered evolutionary theory._

---
The **Garden of Forking Paths** is also a useful metaphor to explain change in the natural world.
When mutations happen in organisms, some pathways become possible that weren't before, while others are closed off. 
Yet again, timing matters. In the last several decades, it has become clear that "mutational order" matters tremendously, even playing an important role in why and how cancers develop. 
It doesn't just matter what the random mutations are, but when they happen, and in which order they occur relative to one another. 
Each path we take, moment by moment, makes some worlds possible, others impossible.

_We look at calendars to gaze into our future and see what comes next. 
But at a more fundamental level, our calendars are the result of a few key decisions made by small groups of people thousands of years ago, shaping the rhythms of our lives and the patterns of modern society. 
Months, named after the moon, were originally tied to lunar cycles. In the earliest days of Rome, people followed a ten-month calendar. adding up to 304 days, with the remainder of the days of a year being lumped together into a winter period of varying length." 
Later reforms added two months, January and February, but the original numbering system remains. 
That's why the names September, October, November, and December refer, linguistically, to the numbers seven, eight, nine, and ten, even though they are now-with the addition of January and February-the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months. Even our naming systems are the living ghosts of past decisions. 
Nonetheless, many of our household budgets rise and fall as we are paid in intervals determined, originally, by the phases of the moon._

_In the first century BC, the planetary week-also seven days long-first appeared in Rome. 
It had nothing to do with rest or work, but instead referred to a belief that certain planets ruled human fates at specific times, an early form of astrology.
Why are there seven days in the planetary calendar? Because five planets were visible to the naked eye (Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus), and with the sun and the moon, that makes seven. 
Romance languages still enshrine these visible celestial bodies in their day names. 
In French, for example, mardi for Mars is Tuesday, mercredi for Mercury is Wednesday, jeudi for Jupiter is Thursday, and vendredi for Venus is Friday. 
The French word for moon is la lune, so Monday is lundi._

_If the Romans had had telescopes and could see other celestial bodies (such as Uranus and Neptune), perhaps humans would now subdivide our lives by nine Instead of seven. (Early Welsh texts speak of a nine-day week.) Or, if the Romans stuck to the planets rather than adding in the sun and the moon, perhaps wed have five-day weeks. 
There were always other options. The ancient Chinese and ancient Egyptians structured their lives in weeks of ten days. 
How different our lives would be. And it's all derived from a contingent mixture of history, vision, technology, and astronomy within a small group of humans who existed during a little sliver of time long, long ago. 
We synchronize our lives with rhythms produced by accidents of history. 
Time, divided in arbitrary ways, lurks in the background of every major event in modern human history and in our own lives. We mostly ignore it._

To understand how science is supposed to work, consider the differences between basketball and rowing. Basketball teams with one exceptional star-the player who can score fifty points in a game-can win even if one of the players on the team is useless.
That makes basketball, to borrow the term from Chris Anderson and David Sally, a **strong-link problem**. 
You can afford to have a weak link-so long as your strongest link is really strong. 

_Spotify is another example of a strong-link problem. Millions and millions of terrible songs can be on Spotify and you'll still be happy, so long as it has the songs that you love best. 
The weak links-those terrible songs you never listen to-don't derail ins effectiveness as a music platform. 
To improve a strong-link problem you can ignore the bad stuff and focus on making the best stuff better._

_Rowing is the exact opposite. Speed is a function of synchronization, balance, and timing.
In a crew of eight rowers and one coxswain, if even one rower is a bit off, the boat will start to lurch side to side, the oars slapping the water and creating drag. 
The crew will lose. They're only as good as their worst athlete. That makes it a **weak-link problem**. Weak-link problems lurk everywhere._

_In the words of the psychologist Adam Mastroianni, "Food safety, for example, is a weak-link problem. 
You don't want to eat anything that will kill you.... A car engine is a weak-link problem: it doesn't matter how great your spark plugs are if your transmission is busted." 
To fix a weak-link problem, you can't focus on the best bits. You must eliminate the weakest links._

_As Mastroianni points out, science is a strong-link problem.
It's the best discoveries that change society, and it doesn't matter much if a bunch of bogus sludge clogs up low-level academic journals. 
Plenty of people had stupid ideas about how to split the atom. That didn't matter because all that was needed was one idea that worked._

First, if we want to get better at understanding ourselves, we need to make (bad) predictions, so that we can learn from those failures and develop new tools to iteratively make better predictions. 
Because of its surprising result, the Fragile Families Challenge will be a major catalyst for innovation in social research. 
We will get better at it, and new tools will overcome many challenges derived from the Easy Problem.

But the second lesson is this: our lives and the future of society are really hard to predict. 
By comparison, rocket science is easy. That's why the Hard Problem will continue to survive, blocking humans from ever fully understanding ourselves. 
In our complex world, some uncertainty cannot be slayed. No matter how hard we try, the flukes of life will continue to mystify us.

---
**Determinism** doesn't mean that we can predict the future. 
Chaos theory shows that seemingly insignificant tweaks to the initial conditions in a deterministic system can produce wildly different results over time. 
Our lives could therefore be both deterministic and utterly unpredictable. The question isn't whether we can anticipate what will happen (we can't), but rather whether everything is caused by what came before.
There are no magical properties that make rain clouds- it's all physics, caused by what came before-but because the system is so complex, we can only reliably predict the weather a few days in advance. 
After two weeks or so, all bets are off. even for the world's best supercomputer. Determinism combined with chaos theory says that we can't change the script, but if we could, then even one microscopic change to the plot or the characters-even a butterfly flapping its wings as it flits across the stage-could alter everything that follows in the rest of the play.

Replaying the tape of life would lead to divergent outcomes only because the random behavior of subatomic particles will never repeat in exactly the same way twice. 
If true, our world is governed-at the smallest levels at least-by genuine randomness.

Some interpretations of quantum effects remain deterministic (such as Bohmian mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation, or superdeterminism). 
The debate is unresolved. Nobody really knows what's going on! However, what's broadly agreed on within much of the scientific community is that one of these two propositions is correct:

1. Determinism is true. <br>
2. The world is indeterministic, but only due to quantum weirdness.

You might notice that a certain proposition is missing from these options: the notion that we, alone, can be independent authors who change our own scripts. 
Where's free will in this scientific consensus?

But we shouldn't shy away from ideas that challenge how we think about our lives and how we behave. 
We should vigorously debate these concepts, not just dismiss them because they're unsettling. 
Turning on the light to examine something that lurks in the darkness is better than pretending it's not there.

To me, determinism is awe-inspiring. Our present moment is woven together with infinite threads that stretch back billions of years. 
Try to pull on one thread, hoping to just change one microscopic corner of the tapestry, and the entire fabric would begin to unravel. 
Pull one thread, change the entire image. Tweak one strand from the past, and you likely wouldn't exist, or perhaps you'd have a different partner, or different children. 
But for a different tiny change, you might also have avoided that horrific heartbreak, or the loss of a loved one, or close friend.
This leads to a deeply moving conclusion.

Is it important whether you feel, deep within your bones, that you could have behaved differently? For me, it's sufficient to know that I can freely pursue my desires. 
Is it really so terrible to imagine that your actions and your thoughts-which will always feel like your own-have been caused not by a phantomlike presence or a homunculus, but instead by a potluck mix of all that you've experienced, your brain chemistry, and everyone and everything that came before you?

You are the contingent culmination of the entirety of cosmic history. Everything had to be exactly as it was for you to exist, just as you are, in this precise moment, in this exact world.
That leads us to a simple, wondrous truth: we all are the living manifestation of 13.7 billion years of flukes.

Perhaps we can finally accept that we will never be able to fully understand our own existence. 
Nonetheless, Kurt Vonnegut gives us good advice on how to live fully within that uncertainty: 
> "A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved"

_This is a despair of our own making, according to the German sociologist Hartmut Rosa, not because of technology, but because of a futile yearning to make the world controllable. 
The categorial imperative of late modernity, Rosa writes, is straightforward but bleak: "Always act in such a way that your share of the world is increased." 
Relationships become a means to an end, reducing a magically networked existence into mere "networking." 
The writer and former nun Karen Armstrong shares this uneasiness, noting that when people visit museums, they no longer simply absorb being next to an object with world-historical implications.
Rather, they take a photograph with their phones and move on, seeking "to own it in some way, as though it does not become real to them until they have a virtual copy." 
But that aspiration for control is misguided, Rosa argues, for "it is only in encountering the uncontrollable that we really experience the world. 
Only then do we feel touched, moved, alive." Even in life's planned celebrations, we most remember the unplanned flourishes._

All of us matter, though some of us will influence events within our lifetimes in more or less profound and visible ways. 
But if we want to maximize the chance that our actions will matter even more, then the best pathway comes from one of the finest innovations our species has ever evolved: cooperation. 
> **Humans who work together create change together.**

That realization doesn’t lead Klaas to nihilism. 
It leads him to care. 
If small actions can ripple outward unpredictably, then influence is everywhere.
The ethical response to uncertainty isn’t paralysis or obsession with optimization—it’s cooperation, curiosity, and presence.

> **We may control nothing, but we influence everything**.

we’ve built a world obsessed with control, efficiency, and predictability, while engineering systems that are fragile at the macro level. 
We’d be better off reversing that—stable structures, but more room for daily serendipity. 
More slack. More wandering. More moments where we stop trying to dominate the future and simply participate in the present.

> **In a universe built on flukes, meaning doesn’t come from mastery. It comes from connection.**
